  "summary": "The diff does not implement the requested backend method. Only a project metadata file was modified; `backend/main.mo` was not changed, so `isCallerAdmin()` is still missing.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Implement a backend canister method `isCallerAdmin()` in `backend/main.mo` as a `public query ({ caller })` function that returns whether `caller` is an admin using the existing access control state, so the frontend `useGetAdminStatus()` / `AdminGuard` can call `actor.isCallerAdmin()` successfully.",
      "reason": "No changes were made to `backend/main.mo` (or any backend Motoko code) in the diff; only `project_state.json` was updated, so the canister does not expose the required query method.",
      "evidence": [
        "project_state.json (only modified file in diff; no backend/main.mo changes present)"
